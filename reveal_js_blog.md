## Introduction

Reveal.js is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML/Markdown. [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

Reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [Markdown content](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). It's best viewed in a modern browser but [fall-backs](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Browser-Support) are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere.

The Reveal.js framework is built around HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. But also has extensive support for Markdown. Reveal.js also supports LaTeX representation of mathematical equations using the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) plugin, enhancing its suitability in the academic domain. Slide decks in Reveal.js are cross platform compatible requiring only a browser to run, and can even be hosted online! Reveal.js presentations are text based so its files are relatively small, and readily version controllable! Overall, Reveal.js brings the beauty of web design, and the ease of markdown to presentation creation!

## Getting Started

A zipped folder with all the neccessary files is available [here](/link/to/FILES), download and extract the files somewhere on your machine

#### Virtual Machine

A [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual machine is available [here](/link/to/VM), all the neccessary files and software are pre-loaded. Open the documents folder, enter the workshop folder and launch the presentation using brackets.
